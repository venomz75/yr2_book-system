# C# Second Year Group Project

The aim of this project was to create a basic website to represent a book store business.
5 of us each took on a seperate component and developed the model(MS Azure/ T-SQL), view(ASP.Net), controller(C#/.NET) for our components. 
Each component had to work independently of one another so a student would be marked for their work only.

Unfortunately, not everybody managed to push their changes to the branch so some components have been left empty. The components and their creators are listed below:

* Adam: Book system
* Akhil: Staff system
* Chris: Review system
* David: Customer system
* Tayyib: Order system
